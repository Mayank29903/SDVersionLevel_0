## Deployment

The project was deployed on **Vercel** directly from the GitHub repository.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Pushed code to GitHub repository.
2. Connected the repository to Vercel.
3. Initially faced issues due to incorrect root directory.
4. Fixed it by changing the project root to `level 0` in Vercel settings.
5. Re-deployed and the site was live successfully.

## Issues Faced

- **Root Directory Problem**:  
  During the first attempt, Vercel was unable to build the project because it was not pointed to the correct directory.  
  **Solution**: Adjusted the root directory in Vercelâ€™s settings to `level 0`, after which the deployment worked fine.
